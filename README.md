This is a simple Amazon clone I built using just HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript.
It’s a straightforward project aimed at replicating the look and feel of Amazon, with basic features like a header, product listings, and a simple shopping cart.
The JavaScript adds some interactivity, but nothing too complex—just enough to give you a feel for how dynamic content works on a webpage. 
It’s perfect for anyone just getting started with web development and looking to practice the basics while building something recognizable!
